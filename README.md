Repository of Open Source Materials for EEE 161, ENGR 104L, and CIS 307

## Directory Overview

- `161/` - Links to open educational resources for electromagnetics (EEE 161)
- `104/` - Links to open educational resources for mechanics of materials (ENGR 104L)
- `307/` - Placeholder for CIS 307 materials
- `OER_EEE161/` - Placeholder for additional course materials



## Purpose
This repository collects quality open educational resources (OERs) for several engineering courses. By gathering freely available lectures, notes, and problem sets in one place, we hope to support students and instructors looking for accessible learning materials across subjects such as electromagnetics and mechanics of materials.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! To add a new resource, fork this repository, append your link to the appropriate course README (for example `161/README.md` or `104/README.md`), and submit a pull request describing the addition.
